I am currently working finalising an [MSc ](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2018/eng/msc-adv-computing-machine-learning/)in Machine Learning at the University of Bristol, before swiftly moving on to a PhD with [Jonathan Lawry](https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/jonathan-lawry(3aac8b8f-816c-4203-ba4b-b091bf4ddef4).html) and [Arthur Richards](https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~aeagr/) in explainable AI for interacting autonomous agents. I am a graduate of the UK's top-ranked general engineering [degree](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/interdisciplinary/engineering-design/), and a holder of a RAEng Engineering Leaders [Scholarship](https://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/schemes-for-students/engineering-leaders-scholarship). 

I want to help to solve our species' greatest problems, in a manner which ensures the resultant reformulation of society is overwhelmingly happy, healthy, ambitious and resilient, rather than fractured and unequal, and incurs the minimum possible negative environmental impact.

*I've also made very little progress on this website; give me a few weeks.*
