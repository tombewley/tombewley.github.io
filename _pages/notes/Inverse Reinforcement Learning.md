A variant of [Imitation Learning](Imitation%20Learning), which also goes by the name of **Inverse Optimal Control**.

It can also be thought of as a form of [Preference-based RL](Preference-based%20RL), in which the demonstrated trajectories are assumed to be preferred to unseen ones, defining *implicit preferences*.
