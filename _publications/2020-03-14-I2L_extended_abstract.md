As we deploy autonomous agents in safety-critical domains, it becomes important to develop an understanding of their internal mechanisms and representations. We outline an approach to imitation learning for reverse-engineering black box agent policies in MDP environments, yielding simplified, interpretable models in the form of decision trees. As part of this process, we explicitly model and learn agentsâ€™ latent state representations by selecting from a large space of candidate features constructed from the Markov state. We present initial promising results from an implementation in a multi-agent traffic environment.
