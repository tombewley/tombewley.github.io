An individual research and design project, culminating in the development of a Python-based computer vision and machine learning system, capable of quantifying and predicting growth progression for microgreens in a vertical farm. I employ techniques including edge detection and colour analysis for low-level image processing, a Gaussian process for time series regression, and a Kalman filter for aggregation of noisy predictions over time.
