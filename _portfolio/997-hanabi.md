[Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)) is a cooperative card game created by Antoine Bauza. Playing the game successfully demands players effectively cultivate a *theory of mind* for each of their team mates. For this reason, Hanabi was recently identified as a challenging ["new frontier for AI research"](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/hanabi-challenge-new-frontier-ai-research).

This ultra-minimal (194 lines of Python 3) Hanabi emulator provides a simple test bed for the Hanabi problem. It should be easy for anybody to run and understand, and has no dependencies aside from the `random` module (for shuffling the deck!)
