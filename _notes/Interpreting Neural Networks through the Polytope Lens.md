This paper argues that the features-as-directions perspective of the [Linear Representation Hypothesis](Linear%20Representation%20Hypothesis) is insufficiently expressive, and that we should instead think of features as *regions* of representation spaces.

The more specific hypothesis is that the polytopes induced by the weights and activation functions of ReLU networks are monosemantic, and that boundaries between them reflect semantic boundaries.
