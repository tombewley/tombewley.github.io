The surge of enthusiasm around [Dictionary Learning](Dictionary%20Learning) effectively takes the [Linear Representation Hypothesis](Linear%20Representation%20Hypothesis) as an axiom. There has been comparatively little research on nonlinear features ([Interpreting Neural Networks through the Polytope Lens](Interpreting%20Neural%20Networks%20through%20the%20Polytope%20Lens)) is one example. This paper uses a clustering technique to find a few such nonlinear features, including a circular representation of days of the week.
